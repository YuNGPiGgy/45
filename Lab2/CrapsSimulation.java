/*
 o	A class representing all the information for the Simulation. This includes:
	o	A CrapsGame object
	o	A CrapsMetricsMonitor object
	o	The user’s name
	o	The user’s balance
	o	The user’s bet
	o	The current win streak
	o	The current lose streak
	
o	Public methods that this class must implement are:
	o	CrapsSimulation()
		o	Constructor that initializes all fields to default values and 
			constructs any objects used (i.e. Scanner, CrapsMetricsMonitor, …)
	o	void start()
		o	Main loop of a single simulation run. This is where the user inputs 
			their name, balance, and bet, runs the simulation, and 
			continues to do so if the user wants to run it again.
